    "* Netcdf4 and HDF5 both have the same underlying file structure\n",
    "    * File struction is called HDF5\n",
    "* Python Netcdf4\n",
    "    * Lots of unlimited size dimensions needs careful attention\n",
    "        * If more than one unlimited dimension, the default chunk size is 1024\n",
    "            * If this dimension ends up with small size, still have a size of 1024 allocated in the file\n",
    "            * Lots of wasted file space\n",
    "        * Unlimited dimensions appear to be detrimental to file size\n",
    "            * Large reduction in file size can be obtained by minimizing the number of unlimited dimensions\n",
    "        * Variable compression (zlib=True) slows way down with multiple unlimited dimensions\n",
    "        * These effects are likely coming from the need to keep rebuilding the variable as the dimension sizes keep changing\n",
    "            * The data has to be uncompressed and then re-compressed\n",
    "            * The gross mismatch of chunk sizes likely exacerbates this\n",
    "                * Both for performance and memory usage\n",
    "    * Example from jedi_bufr2nc\n",
    "        * jedi_bufr2nc.py Aircraft ../bufr2nc/test/data/gdas.t00z.prepbufr.nr aircraft.test.nc\n",
    "        * The input prepbufr file is 49MB\n",
    "        * When compression (level = 6) was used in jed_bufr2nc.py\n",
    "            * Default chunk sizing\n",
    "            * Process took about 20 minutes to run!\n",
    "            * Output file was about 100MB!\n",
    "            * A variable with size (1867,1) was using chunk size (1024,1024)\n",
    "        * Shut off compression (zlib=False)\n",
    "            * Process much faster --> 2 minutes\n",
    "            * But output file huge, 1GB!\n",
    "                * Ridiculous waste, the output data uncompressed should be around 350KB\n",
    "        * Specified chunksize using a size of 1 for all unlimited dimensions\n",
    "            * Runtime about the same\n",
    "            * File size reduced to 86MB\n",
    "                * Way better, but still excessive waste\n",
    "        * Used nccopy for two more improvements\n",
    "            * Change unlimited dims to fixed dims\n",
    "                * nccopy -u infile outfile\n",
    "            * Shuffle and compress file (level 6)\n",
    "                * nccopy -d 6 -s infile outfile\n",
    "            * Recommended to do these in two distict steps\n",
    "                * compression works much more effectively when dims are fixed\n",
    "        * Change unlimited dims to fixed dims\n",
    "            * Long runtime: 5 - 10 minutes\n",
    "            * File reduced to 6MB\n",
    "            * Note: no compress has been applied at this point\n",
    "        * Shuffle and compress file\n",
    "            * Very fast, 1 second\n",
    "            * File reduce to 211KB\n",
    "                * Much more reasonable\n",
    "        * Summary of impacts show in sequence the actions were tried\n",
