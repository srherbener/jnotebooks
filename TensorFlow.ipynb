    "        export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "        TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL is a TensorFlow environment variable responsible for the logs, to silence INFO logs set it to 1, to filter out WARNING 2 and to additionally silence ERROR logs (not recommended) set it to 3\n",

    "## Try an example\n",
    "* MNIST test using softmax regression\n",
