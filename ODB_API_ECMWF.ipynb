    "* ODB website: https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ODBAPI/ODB+API+Home\n",
    "* ODB API is a software developed at ECMWF for encoding and processing of observational data. It includes a SQL filtering and statistics engine, command line tools and APIs for C/C++, Fortran and Python. ODB API works with data format used in ECMWF observational feedback archive. Development of ODB API has been partially funded by the Met Office.\n",
    "    * C/C++ base with Fortran and Python wrappers\n",
    "* ODB examples seem to indicate that the API\n",
    "    * Is for general SQL table creation and access\n",
    "    * Tables have heterogeneous data in columns going across a row\n",
    "        * Cumbersome to accees in C/C++/Fortran\n",
    "        * Not so bad in Python (example uses pandas which makes this easy)\n",
    "* ODB provides a command line tool called \"odb\"\n",
    "    * SQL access, plotting tools, inspect/compare odb files\n",
    "    * This seems more oriented toward observation data\n",
    "* ODB files follow a convention for metadata\n",

    "# Meeting with Yannick, 1/5/18\n",
    "* The ODB file is probably an SQL file\n",
    "    * Developers likely took an open source API for SQL and wired it into ODB\n",
    "* Are there templates for obs type tables in SQL?\n",
    "    * I was looking for the C/C++/Fortran APIs to have something like pandas in Python\n",
    "    * Yannick said that the tendancy is to design a table once, when a new instrument appears, then use that code over and over\n",
    "        * The creation of a new table occurs very infrequently\n",
    "        * Proablay not worth the effort to provide a generic table capability like pandas\n",
    "* The 4 test failures are probably okay for now\n",
    "    * MPI test failures may be indicating that I don't have MPI installed/enabled on my iMac\n",
    "* We will potentially collaborate with ECMWF on development\n",
    "    * Yannick will talk with people at AMS next week\n",
    "    * Depending on how these talks go\n",
    "        * Might get someone from ECMWF to come out here for a week or so to train us\n",
    "        * Or, might go to ECMWF for their annual training session\n",
    "* Use the website and code repository for help with API, examples, etc.\n",
    "    * If this doesn't work well, perhaps the training will happen"
