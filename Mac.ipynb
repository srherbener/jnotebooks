    "\n",
    "* This can be used to make sure your libraries have been compiled using the same compilers that you are going to use for JEDI\n",
    "\n",
    "* Need to do this on the mac since the default compilers are clang\n",
    "    * These have access to gcc, but it's an ancient version (4.x)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Add the --build-from-source option to the brew install command\n",
    "    * --HEAD will check out a version from a repository\n",
    "    * you can define \"head\" in the brew formula which gives you the ability to define a particular branch or tag to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edit a formula\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Need source code\n",
    "    * Brew wants source code so that it can be demonstrated that you can build on your platform\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two ways to provide source code:\n",
    "    * Tar file\n",
    "        * Give brew path to a tarball containing the source code and build configuration\n",
    "        * Can use autoconf, cmake, etc.\n",
    "        * Give brew the sha256 sum for the tar file\n",
    "            * shasum -a256 <tar_file\\>\n",
    "    * Repository\n",
    "        * Give brew url for cloning\n",
    "        * Can specify particular branches or tags\n",
