    "## Mac homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build from source\n",
    "\n",
    "* This can be used to make sure your libraries have been compiled using the same compilers that you are going to use for JEDI\n",
    "\n",
    "* Need to do this on the mac since the default compilers are clang\n",
    "    * These have access to gcc, but it's an ancient version (4.x)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Add the --build-from-source option to the brew install command\n",
    "    * --HEAD will check out a version from a repository\n",
    "    * you can define \"head\" in the brew formula which gives you the ability to define a particular branch or tag to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edit a formula\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formulas are ruby scripts\n",
    "    * To set an environment variable in a formula\n",
    "        * ENV\\['FC'\\] = '/usr/local/bin/gfortran-7'\n",
    "\n",
    "* brew edit <formula\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* After finishing you can check your formula by \"auditing\"\n",
    "    * brew audit <formula\\>\n",
    "    * This checks for acceptability to merge your formula, or edits to and existing formula into the brew repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your own formula\n",
    "\n",
    "* Need source code\n",
    "    * Brew wants source code so that it can be demonstrated that you can build on your platform\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two ways to provide source code:\n",
    "    * Tar file\n",
    "        * Give brew path to a tarball containing the source code and build configuration\n",
    "        * Can use autoconf, cmake, etc.\n",
    "        * Give brew the sha256 sum for the tar file\n",
    "            * shasum -a256 <tar_file\\>\n",
    "    * Repository\n",
    "        * Give brew url for cloning\n",
    "        * Can specify particular branches or tags\n",
    "        * Give brew the sha1 value for the commit you are checking out\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new formula\n",
    "    * brew edit <formula\\>\n",

    "\n",
    "* brew install --verbose --build-from-source --c++11 boost\n",
    "   * says it is ignoring c++11, but it uses c++1 anyway\n",
    "   * c++11 is necessary to get boost name mangling to sync up with JEDI name mangling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulas for open-mpi, hdf5, netcdf\n",
    "\n",
    "* brew edit open-mpi, hdf5, netcdf\n",
    "    * Change depends_on \"gcc\" to \"gcc@7\"\n",
    "    * For Fortran compiling, add: ENV\\['FC'\\] = '/usr/local/bin/gfortran:q'\n",

    "\n",
    "* For netcdf only\n",
    "    * do a brew edit to see the url for downloading netcdf-fortran source tarball\n",
    "    * do a wget to download this tarball, unpack it, and edit the top level CMakeLists.txt\n",
    "        * get rid of the macro-backtrace options to gfortran (these are for clang, not gcc)\n",
    "    * repack the tar ball, and store in a safe place\n",
    "    * run shasum -a256 on the tarball\n",
    "    * brew edit netcdf\n",
    "        * in resource \"fortran\" do\n",
    "            * comment out the specs and replace with url and sha256 values in accordance with the new tarball\n",
    "                * use the file://<full path\\> form of the url\n",
    "\n",
    "* brew install --verbose --build-from-source open-mpi, hdf5, netcdf\n",
